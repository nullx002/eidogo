planned for 1.0
- fix broken back button in IE (change links to "#kjd" + onclick handler to invoke history loader?)
- uploading (or url or paste), fetch restrictions
- unsaved changes notice for permalink, save
- show resignation comment
- blank 9x9, 13x13 boards
- showTools preference (disallow implicit selection too)
- create compact embeddedable version
- test multiple instances on a page
- time left issue
- brief help text (keyboard shortcuts, etc)

planned for after 1.0
- improve forward/back behavior in IE
- continuations for pattern search
- "more" search results link
- game archive browsing/searching
- decouple player and board renderer (click events)
- canvas renderer: dojo.gfx or similar? (non-regular-sized boards)
- exhaustive FF[4] SGF support
- checkboxes for preferences
- Facebook App??

maybe
- navigable variation tree like CGoban
- more robust SGF parser
- hold down arrow keys to keep navigating in FF/Safari (keydown, keyup)
