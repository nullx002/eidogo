planned for 1.0
- use base 62 number for games instead of predictable digits
- showTools preference (disallow implicit selection too)
- load search results via front page rather than Player to keep history
  state separated from core functionality. consider the same for permalinks?
  create gameloadhandler/permalinkhandler?
- use hashes for permalinks!
- search results back navigation or permalinks
- hold down arrow keys to keep navigating
- checkboxes for preferences
- game archive browsing/searching
- brief help text (keyboard shortcuts, etc)
- figure out why updateControls is slow in FF when there are lots of search results
  (guessing YUI/DOM related)

maybe
- decouple player and board renderer
- canvas renderer?
- uploading
- exhaustive FF[4] SGF support
- more robust SGF parser
- navigable variation tree like CGoban
