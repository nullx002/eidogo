EidoGo was created to be a web-based joseki tutor based on Kogo's Joseki Dictionary. Serving in this capacity, its main advantages are that:

1) it's web-based, so you can access it anywhere without downloading and installing anything; and

2) that it progressively loads branches from an extremely large tree of possible move sequences, instead of trying to load them all at once, which is very slow.

Since then, EidoGo has become more of a generic SGF replayer. It has recently undergone a complete rewrite to make it modular and portable. The old version was poorly written and buggy. The new version takes advantage of the newest client-side web development techniques such as semantic XHTML, DOM scripting, and AJAX. It can be plugged easily into any page and can read raw SGF data from a JavaScript variable or from a URL within the same domain.

As far as I know, there are no other fully-functional, modular web-based solutions. They are all proprietary, incomplete, or difficult to embed in your own site.

Anyone is encouraged to use EidoGo on their own site. Bug reports, feature suggestions, and code contributions are all welcome.
