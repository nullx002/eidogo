To use Kogo's Joseki Dictionary with progressive loading:

0) Prerequisites: a web server with PHP and MySQL

1) Download KJD from http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm
2) Save the .sgf file as 'sgf/kjd.sgf'
3) Set up a MySQL database and make note of the login info.
4) Import php/kjd_structure.sql into the MySQL database.
5) Remove the .default extension from the files
     php/db.php.default
6) Update db.php with the MySQL login information from step 3.
7) Run kjd_insert.php, preferably from a shell, since it may
   use a lot memory and take a while to process.
8) Point the Player cfg setting sgfUrl at php/kjd_progressive.php
   and set progressiveLoad to true.
