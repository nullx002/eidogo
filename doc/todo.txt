planned for 1.0
- shortcuts for player.js (t = eidogo.i18n, etc)
- showTools preference (disallow implicit selection too)
- load search results via front page rather than Player to keep history
  state separated from core functionality. consider the same for permalinks?
  create gameloadhandler/permalinkhandler?
- figure out why updateControls is slow when there are lots of search results
  (guessing YUI/DOM related)
- use hashes for permalinks!
- search results back navigation or permalinks
- gameUrl setting for permalinks of loaded games
- hold down arrow keys to keep navigating
- checkboxes for preferences
- game archive browsing/searching
- brief help text (keyboard shortcuts, etc)

maybe
- uploading
- exhaustive FF[4] SGF support
- more robust SGF parser
- navigable variation tree like CGoban

done
- search caching
- implicit mouse-drag region select
- detect point width and height
- add letter/number labels
- f1 or esc to select "play" tool

suggestions for ulrich
- move number, variation as individual field
- search hit limit
