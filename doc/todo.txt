- uploading (or url or paste), fetch restrictions
- unsaved changes notice for permalink, save
- security checks for fetch.php
- show resignation comment
- "more" search results link
- showTools preference (disallow implicit selection too)
- create compact embeddedable version
- test multiple instances on a page
- "download eidogo"?
- time left issue
- brief help text (keyboard shortcuts, etc)
- get rid of comments in css/code

planned for after 1.0
- improve forward/back behavior in IE
- continuations for pattern search
- game archive browsing/searching
- decouple player and board renderer (click events)
- canvas renderer: dojo.gfx or similar? (can do non-regular-sized boards)
- exhaustive FF[4] SGF support

maybe
- navigable variation tree like CGoban
