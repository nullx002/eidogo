planned for 1.0
- use base 62 number for games instead of predictable digits
- showTools preference (disallow implicit selection too)
- create compact embeddedable version
- move source.html to index, dom show/hide
- "download eidogo"
- brief help text (keyboard shortcuts, etc)

maybe
- hold down arrow keys to keep navigating
- checkboxes for preferences
- game archive browsing/searching
- decouple player and board renderer
- canvas renderer?
- uploading
- exhaustive FF[4] SGF support
- more robust SGF parser
- navigable variation tree like CGoban
